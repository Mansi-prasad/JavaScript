    <!-- this in Event Handlers
        In HTML event handlers, this refers to the HTML element that received the event: -->

      // this keyword refers to an object.
      // In an object method====> this refers to the object.
      // Alone====> this refers to the global object.
      // In a function====> this refers to the global object.
      // In a function===> in strict mode, this is undefined.
      // In an event====> this refers to the element that received the event.
      // Methods like call(), apply(), and bind()====> can refer this to any object.

      // 1. this in a method
      // When used in an object method, this refers to the object.

      // 2. this Alone
      // When used alone, this refers to the global object.
      let a = this;
      // console.log(a);
      // this in a Function
      // In a browser window the global object is [object Window]
      // In a function, the global object is the default binding for this.

          return this;
        },
      };
      console.log("pi fun= ", p1.fun());

      // Explicit Function Binding
      // call() and apply() methods are predefined JavaScript methods.
      // They can both be used to call an object method with another object as argument.

      // With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.
