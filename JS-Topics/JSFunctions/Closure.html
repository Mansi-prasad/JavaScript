      <h1>JavaScript Closures</h1>
      <p>
        JavaScript variables can belong to: <br />The local scope or The global
        scope
      </p>
      <p>
        Global variables can be made local (private) with closures. Closures
        makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
      </p>
      <h2>Variable Lifetime</h2>
      <p>
        Global variables live until the page is discarded, like when you
        navigate to another page or close the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local variables have short lives. They are created when the function is
        invoked, and deleted when the function is finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Closure makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
      </p>

  <script>
    // JavaScript supports nested functions. Nested functions have access to the scope

    //A closure is a function that has access to the parent scope, after the parent function has closed.
    function add() {
      let val = 0;
      return function () {
        val++; //  it can access the val in its parent scope.
        return val;
      };
    }
    let res = add(); // assigned to the return value of a function.
    console.log("Incremented value: ", res());
