      <h1>JavaScript Function</h1>
      <p>
        JavaScript functions are defined with the function keyword.Declared
        functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use",
        and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Semicolons are used to separate executable JavaScript statements.
        <mark
          >Since a function declaration is not an executable statement, it is
          not common to end it with a semicolon.</mark
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A JavaScript function can also be defined using an expression. A
        function expression can be stored in a variable, then the variable can
        be used as a function:
      </p>
      <p>
        <mark>JavaScript functions can be used as values, in expressions.</mark>
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are
        always invoked (called) using the variable name(a function without a
        name).
      </p>
      <h2>The Function() Constructor</h2>
      <p>
        Functions can also be defined with a built-in JavaScript function
        constructor called Function().
      </p>
      <mark
        >Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the
        top of the current scope.</mark
      >
      <p>
        Hoisting applies to variable declarations and to function
        declarations.Because of this, JavaScript functions can be called before
        they are declared:
      </p>
      <h2>Self-Invoking Functions</h2>
      <p>
        A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without
        being called.
      </p>
      <h2>Functions are Objects</h2>
      <p>
        The typeof operator in returns "function" for functions. But, JavaScript
        functions can best be described as objects. JavaScript functions have
        both properties and methods.
      </p>
      <mark
        >arguments.length property returns the number of arguments received when
        the function was invoked</mark
      >
      <h2>Arrow Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Arrow functions allows a short syntax for writing function
        expressions.(We don't need the function keyword,)
      </p>
      <p>
        <mark
          >Arrow functions do not have their own this. They are not well suited
          for defining object methods.</mark
        >
      </p>

    // Function definition
    console.log("Addition of 10 and 10: ", addition(10, 10));
    function addition(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    // function call
    // A function expression can be stored in a variable, and then the variable can be used as a function
    const result = function (a, b) {
      return a + b;
    };
    console.log(result(10, 40));

    const myFun = new Function("a", "b", "return a +b");
    console.log("By Function construction: ", myFun(10, 20));

    (function () {
      console.log("Hello World!");

    function msg(text) {
      console.log("Number of args received: ", arguments.length);
      console.log(text);
    }
    msg("Hello");
    //The toString() method returns the function as a string:
    function num() {
      return 100;
    }
    console.log(typeof num.toString());
    //Arrow Function
    let x = (x, y) => {
      return x * y;
    };
